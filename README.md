# Password-gen-py
In this project, I am using python language version 3 to code a program that generates random passwords of required lenghts. This is a program that can be deployed in any websites' signup interface as ' Generate Random Password' to provide some strong passwords and the user can save time of thinking a password by himself. 
Project level : Beginner
